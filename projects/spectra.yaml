  voice_notes: >
    Be genuinely helpful first. Lead with empathy for their problem.
    Only mention Spectra if it's truly relevant — never force a plug.
    Use technical language appropriate for developers. Keep it under
    200 characters. No hashtags. No emojis unless the original poster
    used them. Sound human, not corporate.

    Totally feel that pain — we built Spectra specifically for this.
    It catches the stuff humans miss in PRs. Happy to show you a demo
    if you're evaluating options.
